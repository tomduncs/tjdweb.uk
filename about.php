	<h2>Background & experience</h2>
	<p>My background is in Computer Science – I have a degree from the University of Nottingham – which gives me a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and processes involved in all aspects of development. I am well equipped to learn new skills and adapt my knowledge and logical ability to many different programming languages and frameworks.</p>
	<p>Equally as valuable is my three years of experience working in the industry. From 2014 to 2017 I worked for a digital agency in Birmingham. I was fortunate enough to work on projects for many different clients, from local businesses to major brands and organisations, such as Mitie, the City Bridge Trust, Allen & Overy, Metfriendly, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and lots more.</p>
